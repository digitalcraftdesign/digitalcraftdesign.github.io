Here, I showcase the educational journey and milestones that have shaped my expertise in electronics and design.</p><section class="chapter"><h2 id="education-and-training" data-toc="education-and-training">Education and Training</h2><p id="h3uz79_6"><span class="control" id="h3uz79_8">Licence Technique, LT Power Electronics &ndash; National Pedagogical Institute of Technical Education (IPNET), Beirut, Lebanon, 2017</span><br> In Power Electronics, I focused on the principles and applications of converting, controlling, and conditioning electric power. My studies covered essential concepts in AC-DC, DC-DC, and DC-AC conversion, along with in-depth analysis of power semiconductor devices like MOSFETs, IGBTs, and diodes used in high-efficiency circuits. I specialized in designing and analyzing switching-mode power supplies (SMPS), inverters, and converters, including techniques for pulse-width modulation (PWM) and control strategies for stable power regulation. Additionally, I explored EMI/EMC design considerations, thermal management, and protection circuitry, which are critical for ensuring reliability and efficiency in real-world applications, such as renewable energy systems, motor drives, and industrial power systems. This background has equipped me with the skills to design robust power systems and optimize electronic devices for power efficiency and performance.</p><p id="h3uz79_7"><span class="control" id="h3uz79_10">Technicien Sup&eacute;rieur, TS Electronics &ndash; AL Makassed Abdel Hadi Debs Vocational and Technical Center, Beirut, Lebanon, 2016</span><br> In Electronics, I specialized in the fundamental principles and applications of analog and digital circuit design. My studies included core concepts like Ohm&rsquo;s Law, Kirchhoff's Laws, and semiconductor physics, which laid the groundwork for understanding transistors, diodes, and operational amplifiers. I gained experience in designing, analyzing, and troubleshooting various circuits, from simple amplifiers and filters to more complex oscillators and signal processors. I also focused on digital logic design, learning about logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, and memory components. This knowledge extended to microcontroller programming and embedded systems, where I learned to interface sensors, control actuators, and implement communication protocols like I2C, SPI, and UART. Additionally, I explored PCB design techniques, signal integrity, and power management to create reliable, efficient circuits suitable for practical applications across various domains, including industrial automation, communication systems, and consumer electronics. This foundation has been instrumental in my work, enabling me to design and troubleshoot electronics systems with a high degree of accuracy and functionality.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="continued-learning" data-toc="continued-learning">Continued Learning</h2><section class="chapter"><h3 id="developing-microcontroller-applications" data-toc="developing-microcontroller-applications"><span class="control" id="h3uz79_21">Developing Microcontroller Applications</span></h3><p id="h3uz79_14">To stay current and expand my knowledge in developing microcontroller applications, I regularly dive into industry literature, courses, and hands-on projects. I frequently explore datasheets, application notes, and reference designs from major microcontroller manufacturers, such as Microchip, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments. This approach helps me understand specific components and applications in depth.</p><p id="h3uz79_15">I also keep up with advancements through online platforms and communities, like forums on Stack Overflow, Embedded Systems Stack Exchange, and specialized subreddits, where professionals share insights and troubleshooting tips. Additionally, I subscribe to newsletters, webinars, and virtual workshops hosted by key players in the field.</p><p id="h3uz79_16">Experimenting with new architectures and families of microcontrollers is another way I stay ahead. For example, I might try different setups with PIC, AVR, or ARM Cortex-M series, each with unique strengths and application domains. I build projects to deepen my experience in real-time applications, peripheral configuration, and low-power designs. This hands-on practice, combined with exploring more advanced development environments like MPLAB X IDE, helps me stay well-prepared for new challenges in microcontroller development.</p><p id="h3uz79_17">To formalize my expertise and stay competitive, I am also pursuing relevant certifications.
